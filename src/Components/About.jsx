            Hello, I'm Duval üëãüèº, I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion
            for growth, development, and innovation. I have numerous experience
            in frontend and backend technologies. I have a knack for technology
            and a passion for pursuing knowledge. I build websites using HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS/PostgreSQL
            for the backend of my projects. I am very laid back, but also a
            passionate person who pursues his dreams. I enjoy stepping out of my
            comfort zone and taking on new challenges. I am currently accepting
            project opportunities, clients, or employment.
          </p>
